# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project  

Can we use patient health records to **predict the presence of heart disease**?  
This project takes us through the complete **machine learning workflow**: from exploring the dataset to building and evaluating predictive models.

## 📊 Dataset Overview  

Each row represents a patient and their medical attributes:  

| Feature   | Description | Example Values |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| age       | Age in years | 29, 45, 60 |
| sex       | 1 = male; 0 = female | 0, 1 |
| cp        | Chest pain type (0–3) | 0: Typical, 1: Atypical, 2: Non-anginal, 3: Asymptomatic |
| trestbps  | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) | 120, 140 |
| chol      | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) | 180, 250 |
| fbs       | Fasting blood sugar >120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) | 0, 1 |
| restecg   | Resting ECG results (0–2) | 0: Normal, 1: ST-T abnormality, 2: LVH |
| thalach   | Max heart rate achieved | 160, 190 |
| exang     | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) | 0, 1 |
| oldpeak   | ST depression induced by exercise | 0.5, 2.0 |
| slope     | Slope of ST segment (0–2) | 0: Upsloping, 1: Flat, 2: Downsloping |
| ca        | # of major vessels (0–3) | 0, 2 |
| thal      | Thalium stress test result | 3: Normal, 6: Fixed, 7: Reversible |
| target    | Presence of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no) | 0, 1 |

## 🚀 Workflow  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand patterns, distributions, and correlations.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Process categorical/numerical features for model readiness.  
3. **Model Training** – Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.  
5. **Model Comparison** – Benchmark different algorithms.  
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimize models for better performance.  
7. **Feature Importance** – Identify which health factors contribute most to predictions.  
8. **Cross-Validation** – Ensure reliability on unseen data.  
9. **Reporting Results** – Summarize findings in a clear, visual format.

## 🏆 Goal  

To **build a reliable model** that can help predict the likelihood of heart disease, providing insights into the most important contributing health factors.

## 📌 Future Enhancements  

- Add interactive dashboards (Streamlit/Gradio).  
- Deploy trained model as a web app or API.  
- Collect more real-world medical data for stronger validation.
